# Overview

This project is a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier application built using the Flask web framework. It provides a straightforward way to demonstrate and interact with the KNN algorithm for classification tasks. Users can input data, and the application will classify it based on the patterns learned from a training dataset. This project aims to offer a clear, web-based interface for understanding and utilizing the KNN machine learning algorithm.
